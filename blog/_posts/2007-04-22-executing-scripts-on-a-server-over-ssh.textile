title: Executing scripts on a server over SSH
---

It took me a while to figure out how to run, for instance, @configure@ on a remote server while working in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">Secure Shell</a>. I was surprised to see that @./configure@ returnes a "not found" error. The simple solution is to do @/bin/theshell ./script@ :).

*Tip:* Here's how you can determine the shell you're using (you can't be sure about remote machines):

<pre>
<code>
$ echo $SHELL
</code>
</pre>

and perhaps a bit more about yourself:

<pre>
<code>
$ finger -m _username_
</code>
</pre>

Btw, I believe that *comp.lang.ssh* is the best place to ask questions about SSH.
