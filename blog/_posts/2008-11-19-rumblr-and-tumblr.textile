title: Rumblr and Tumblr
---

Today I was having some fun setting up a <a href="http://markoa.tumblr.com/">blog on Tumblr</a> because I think that it's a nice way of archiving links to useful articles that I've read online for example, instead of making 1234th bookmark somewhere. And I really like the esthetics.

But I also saw that they a simple REST <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/api">API</a>, so I wrote a Ruby <a href="http://github.com/markoa/scripts/tree/master">script called rumblr</a> which is a nifty way of posting there from the console.

Here's a screenshot (it runs on Compiz!):
