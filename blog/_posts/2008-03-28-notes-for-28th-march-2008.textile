Migrated to a new host, upgraded to WordPress 2.3.3, took advantage of the availability of post categories together with tags.

The correct procedure of upgrading the blog was to export the old database to an SQL file, create a new database and database user on a new server, copy WordPress files, import the old DB, then go to the WP upgrade (not install) page, which upgraded the DB to a new format.

After <a href="http://github.com/">github</a> earlier, today I discovered <a href="http://gitorious.org/">gitorious</a>, another place to host open source projects with <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> for version control. Note that there's <a href="http://www.assembla.com/">Assembla</a> as well, providing excellent <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> + <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</a> infrastructure.
