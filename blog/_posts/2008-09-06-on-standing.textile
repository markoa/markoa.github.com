title: On standing

Lately I've been mostly standing while working on the computer. At one point I realized that I don't have to sit all the time and how unnatural for a human is to sit for so long so I took a bunch of books from my shelves and stacked them up on the desk so that the keyboard and mouse are on a convenient level. It might be tricky at first, your legs might hurt and it's not very easy generally but after a while that goes away. Now I never feel crushed after I turn off the computer.
