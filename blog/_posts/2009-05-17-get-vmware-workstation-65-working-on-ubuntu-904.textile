title: Get VMWare Workstation 6.5 working on Ubuntu 9.04
---

This is actually the first time I upgrade a distro using the package manager and not by formatting the root partition and doing it from scratch - and it worked pretty well, Ubuntu Jaunty is now running happily.

Re-installing VMWare from the bundle though won't be enough, because it needs its modules to be rebuilt for the upgraded system files. What it takes is:
<pre>sudo mv /usr/lib/vmware/modules/binary /usr/lib/vmware/modules/binary.old
sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all</pre>
