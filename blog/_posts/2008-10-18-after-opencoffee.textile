title: After OpenCoffee
---

I wasn't home much yesterday so with a small delay I'm mentioning Thursday's <a href="http://www.opencoffeenovisad.org">OpenCoffee</a> <a href="http://plakatt.com/events/134-opencoffee-novi-sad-15">meetup</a>, my second so far. It's a very nice way of bringing local Internet people together, we showed <a href="http://plakatt.com">Plakatt</a> - people seem to like it - and had interesting discussions.

If only I brought my jacket along. It's an October evening after all.
