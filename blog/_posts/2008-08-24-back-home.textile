On Friday I finally returned from my longest and most exciting trip ever. After GUADEC I stayed in Turkey for a while, went to Georgia for a week, then travelled through Turkey for about a month and a half in total, on the train and road with my friend Lea, meeting great people through <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com/">CouchSurfing</a> and seeing and experiencing so many things while in Istanbul, Erzurum, Batumi, Tbilisi, Telavi, David Gareja, Hopa, Trabzon, Ani, Ankara, Capadocia, Konya, Eskisehir, Izmir. I know that it will take me a couple of days before getting into shape for the usual work. Photos coming.
