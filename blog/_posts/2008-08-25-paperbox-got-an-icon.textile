title: Paperbox got an icon
---

While I was away, <a href="http://cubestuff.wordpress.com/2008/08/09/paperbox-goes-tango/">Jakub Szypulka designed a Tango-style icon for Paperbox</a>. Thanks so much! It's in svn now and will be in use as of the next release.

In other news, I listed a few features that should be in the next release, in the 0.4 roadmap on the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/PaperBox">project wiki page</a>.
