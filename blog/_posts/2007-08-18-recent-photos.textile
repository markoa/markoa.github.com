I've slowly finished uploading some of the photos I've taken in England and GUADEC and a few at home to my recently-created Flickr account. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/10012147@N04/"><img src="http://marko.anastasov.name/images/dscf0117.resized.jpg" alt="A photo from Birmingham" /></a> I have very recently bought my first digital camera so I still need to practice, but I think that some of them are quite good.
