title: Micronas shuts down consumer division
---

This is news from four days ago, but for me this is news of the month at least. Yesterday <a href="http://twitter.com/darko_fabijan" target="_blank">Darko</a> told me but I took it as a btw thing and forgot; today he mentioned that a friend said his master's thesis project has been cancelled while being almost finished because of this. (The same thing would've happenned to me if I stayed to graduate and work there, as I was in the DSP team which gets and shares jobs with those guys in Freiburg.)

Micronas, here also known as the big daddy of about a hundred engineers and students in Novi Sad, is <a href="http://www.micronas.com/investor/investornewsadhocpublicity/articles/PR0901/index.html?newslang=1" target="_blank">shutting down its consumer electronics division</a>. This is the one whose main business are audio and video processors for digital TV sets, contributing <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=213200778" target="_blank">two thirds to the company's total sales</a>. Meanwhile they'll try to find a buyer for what remains, and a "diversification of the automotive division will be pushed into new markets such as industrial products and white goods".

If you ask me, people don't really need that latest video codec, backed by a Prologic surround sound on a 50' plasma TV.
