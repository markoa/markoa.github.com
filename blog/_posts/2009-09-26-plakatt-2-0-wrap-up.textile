title: Plakatt 2.0 wrap up
---

On Tuesday, 2009-09-22, <a href="http://plakatt.com" target="_blank">Plakatt</a> 2.0 went live. Many exciting and life-changing things have happenned since I <a href="http://www.marko.anastasov.name/blog/2008/09/23/plakatt/" target="_blank">mentioned it</a> for the first time on this blog a year ago. We started a <a href="http://renderedtext.com" target="_blank">company</a>, teamed up with <a href="http://sprawsm.com" target="_blank">Sprawsm</a>, worked on different things that kept us from making it earlier. On the other hand, taking a break, then putting a lot of thinking into every aspect of the site might've had some good effect. The idea is still the same, however almost the entire user experience is redefined.
