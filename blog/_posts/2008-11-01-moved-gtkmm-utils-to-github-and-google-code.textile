title: Moved gtkmm-utils to GitHub and Google Code
---

Today I moved gtkmm-utils away from Savannah which I now dislike to github for managing the public <a href="http://github.com/markoa/gtkmm-utils/tree/master">code repository</a> and google for the rest of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gtkmm-utils/">project</a> activities.
