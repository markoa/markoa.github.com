title: My first git-svn
---

My goal was to set up a local git repository for some experiments I plan to do with Paperbox, whose code is hosted on Gnome SVN. It's very easy to do, *man git-svn* tells you everything (such things couldn't happen two years ago):

I also checked live.gnome.org, and the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GitForGnomeDevelopers" target="_blank">GitForGnomeDevelopers</a> page tells me about the @--squash@ option for git-merge. It seems that it should be used when merging local development branches to master after master got some changes committed in the meantime to SVN HEAD.
