While reading [Ryan Dahl's recent rant](https://plus.google.com/115094562986465477143/posts/Di6RwCNKCrf) I've noticed how he often jumps publishing sites. He used to be (and still is, sometimes) [on LiveJournal](http://four.livejournal.com/) back in the day. Obviously I've been into having your domain and owning your data and all that, but there's something compelling about being homeless on the web.

When you own your domain and managing your stuff, you're stuck with it for a long timeâ€”rarely you get the time and inspiration to change something. You usually need to make a little more effort in "promoting" it. Statistically it's more likely that you will not renew your domain than that the free blogging platform will disappear. If they're worth it, your _creations_ will live their own life. These are all just words in the end.
