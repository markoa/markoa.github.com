title: Emacs and Xft fonts
---

The thing I disliked about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs">Emacs</a> is the limited set of fonts you can tell it to display, and how the default font it starts with is too small. I guess there's a way to specify the X font and its' size somehow but I never figured it out (ie Google hasn't). So when I'd start it, I'd always do Shift-click to select a bigger font, which over time becomes tedious. That repetitiveness aside, I really wanted to have pretty fonts in Emacs, and stop occasionally getting into other editors just because they show a Bitstream or DejaVu family font (yes, esthetics matter). Something like this:

Now, Emacs 22 is finally out, and it even has a Gtk+ interface (which is not that important since anyone with even a minimal degree of dignity never touches the mouse while using Emacs or <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> :)). I haven't tested it (there's currently no package for <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">FC6</a>), but from the long <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.22.1">NEWS</a> it seems that things have not changed about fonts. What it takes would be the support for <a href="http://www.fontconfig.org/">Xft</a>-rendered fonts, which allows <a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/index2.html">FreeType</a>'s antialiased fonts with the X Window system. The solution is to build your new Emacs from the emacs-unicode-2 branch which should eventually become Emacs 23. Here are the steps I did:

Check it out:<!--more-->

@cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/emacs co -r emacs-unicode-2 emacs@

Take a minute to read through all the options you can configure it with:

@cd emacs/
./configure --help@

I configured with:

@./configure --with-xpm --with-freetype --enable-font-backend --with-xft --with-gtk --program-suffix=-cvs@

(Notice the program suffix to prevent the name clash in your bin path group.)

First you need to

@make bootstrap@

which will build the Lisp part. Then do @make@ and @make install@.

You specify the font Emacs should load by setting a property
in ~/.Xresources:

@echo "Emacs.font: Bitstream Vera Sans Mono-14" >> ~/.Xresources@

Before launching, reload the Xresources file with:

@xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources@

Now run @emacs-cvs@. You may notice that there are some new modes, such as XML.

;; Btw, if you're tired of Emacs not working with the same clipboards as other desktop applications, paste these lines in your @.emacs@ file (works for version 21 too):

@(setq x-select-enable-clipboard t)
(setq interprogram-paste-function 'x-cut-buffer-or-selection-value)@
