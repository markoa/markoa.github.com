title: Form scope in partials
---

Say you have a typical form in Ruby on Rails which begins with:

<pre>
<code>
<% form_for :user do |f| -%>
  <label for="user_name">User name</label>
  <%= f.text_field :user_name %>
</code>
</pre>

And for some reason you'd like to have a form field separated in a partial. You might wonder (like I did) what to do since you cannot pass the form helper object (@f@) around. But in the partial you're also in the form object's scope, so you can call helper methods simply as:

<pre>
<code>
<%= text_field :user, :email %>
</code>
</pre>
