Found a great quote in the _<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/03/17.html">Martian Headsets</a>_ post from Joel Spolsky:

bq. Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.

...which comes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel">Jon Postel</a> in the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">TCP RFC</a>.

It's clearly not a statement limited to network protocols.
