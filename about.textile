I make web software at "Rendered Text":http://renderedtext.com. Apart from client work, with "friends":http://plakatt.com/about I'm working on "Plakatt":http://plakatt.com, a website for sharing and discovering events. And I do "open source":/open-source too.

I live in Novi Sad, Serbia and can play Roland by Interpol with great precision.

These pages are generated with "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll, wrapped in HTML5 and typeset in "Fontin Sans":http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontinsans.html. The last word on the front page is anything that comes to my mind before I'm about to push a new post to this site's "git":http://git-scm.com/ repository.
