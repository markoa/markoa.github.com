h2. It's all or nothing about the author

I make useful software at "Rendered Text":http://renderedtext.com.

With "friends":http://plakatt.com/about I'm working on "Plakatt":http://plakatt.com, a website for publishing, discovering and sharing events.

I live in Novi Sad, Serbia and can play Roland by Interpol with great precision.

h2. Open source

Over the years, mostly while at university and before starting a company, I spent a lot of my free time learning, tinkering and contributing to open source software projects. At that time, it was all about what's on and below the Linux desktop for me, and I couldn't have guessed that I'd end up programming for the web. As it always happens, I've submitted patches to many different projects, but here I list those that I released or made a significant contribution to, in order of appearance:

* "USBSink":http://usbsink.sourceforge.net/ &mdash; file synchronization app between a computer and USB devices.
* "gtkmm":http://www.gtkmm.org &mdash; Gnome and GTK+ C++ bindings.
* "Paperbox":http://live.gnome.org/PaperBox &mdash; document browser.
* "gtkmm-utils":http://code.google.com/p/gtkmm-utils/ &mdash; reusable widgets and classes based on gtkmm and glibmm.
* "wordtip":http://github.com/markoa/wordtip &mdash; an incomplete text classification desktop service.
* "Tumblefile":http://github.com/markoa/tumblefile &mdash; automatic, chronological file organizer.
