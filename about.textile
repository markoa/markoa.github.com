h2. It's all or nothing about the author

I make useful software at "Rendered Text":http://renderedtext.com.

With "friends":http://plakatt.com/about I'm working on "Plakatt":http://plakatt.com, a website for publishing, discovering and sharing events.

In past I used to write more open source software like "Paperbox":http://live.gnome.org/PaperBox, contribute to the "gtkmm project":http://www.gtkmm.org (Gnome C++ bindings) for which I have some "utility extensions":http://code.google.com/p/gtkmm-utils/, and I built "USBSink":http://usbsink.sourceforge.net/ long time ago. My latest release has been "Tumblefile":http://github.com/markoa/tumblefile.

These days I'm also finishing my master's thesis. That sentence has been true
for way too long now.

I live in Novi Sad, Serbia and can play Roland by Interpol with great precision.

h2(#elsewhere). Elsewhere

* "Twitter":http://twitter.com/markoa &mdash; follow me to keep in touch on a more frequent basis.
* "Flickr":http://flickr.com/photos/manastasov &mdash; my attempts at photography.
* "Tumblr":http://omegawm.tumblr.com &mdash; a blog which is my collection of news, ideas and pictures.
* "Last.fm":http://last.fm/user/last_ape &mdash; some music listening statistics.
* "GitHub":http://github.com/markoa &mdash; open source code which is not on Gnome servers.

I'm also part of the following blogs:

* "Rendered Text blog":http://renderedtext.com/blog &mdash; sharing some of the knowledge from our daily work.
* "Ruby.rs":http://ruby.rs &mdash; Serbian Ruby community which I helped make happen.

h2. About this site

The blog that I write here represents my personal views, mostly on the topics of computers and programming. The pages are generated by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll, wrapped in HTML5 and typeset in "Fontin Sans":http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontinsans.html. If it looks strange then you're probably using a browser which doesn't conform to web standards, such as Internet Explorer.
